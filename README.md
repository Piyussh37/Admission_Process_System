# Admission Process System

The Admission Process System is a console-based application designed to emulate a website's functionality, providing a comprehensive and user-friendly experience for users seeking information about college admissions, facilities, and more. This project is implemented in Python, leveraging powerful libraries such as NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and webbrowser.

## Features

- **Main Menu**: Displays options like Admission Information, College Address, Placement Records, and more.
- **Sub-Choices**: Each main menu option contains sub-choices to provide detailed information.
- **User-Friendly Navigation**: Users can navigate back to the main menu or exit the program anytime.
- **Persistent Execution**: The application runs continuously until explicitly stopped.
- **Administrator and User Modes**: The system has two modes:
  - **Administrator**: Manages student admissions and monitors the process.
  - **User**: Views student details but cannot perform any changes.

## Libraries Used

- **NumPy**: Performs mathematical operations on arrays and matrices.
- **pandas**: Imports files (csv, excel, word) and creates dataframes from lists and dictionaries.
- **matplotlib**: Plots data and provides an object-oriented API for embedding plots.
- **webbrowser**: Displays web-based documents to users.

## How to Run

1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Install the required libraries using:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
3. python main.py
